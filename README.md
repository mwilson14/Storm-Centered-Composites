# Storm-Centered-Composites
Code for creating storm-centered radar images, as well as rotated composites.

This repository contains a script for creating storm-following radar volumes given a list of times and storm locations, for performing advection correction on those volumes, and compositing together multiple volumes into storm-centeres rotated composites.
